# Virtual Travel

This is just a simple website built with Vite React.

![Screenshot of the website's homepage and how it looks when it is opened in a browser](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1cs8ZFeBrkNa9fnasu5OrhL7ywczWl9Ro)

## Purpose

Its purpose is to help me learn to use React, react router, RESTful API ([The Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/)), [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon) and [swiper](https://swiperjs.com/).

## What it includes

The project is a website that allows one to "virtually travel", i.e. read about different parts of the world. Of course, the project doesn't include any real information and it contains mostly "dummy" text, aside from, of course, the images provided by [PEXELS](https://www.pexels.com/), as it serves essentially for practice. The time is provided in different cities using [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon).

User can also read about creators on About page, fill out a form on Contact page, and Log in and Sign up. However, one should note that logging in and signing up essentially does nothing.
